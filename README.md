### Hi there!
My name is Matthew Purri, I am currently a PhD candidate at Rutgers University. I am studying computer vision and machine learning. My thesis is concentrated on understanding object properties from visual information. I have previously interned at Amazon, Clarifai, and Kitware. I am currently working on studying polarized light for improving computer vision algorithms and using transformer networks for vision tasks.

### Current Topics of Interest
* Transformer Networks
* AutoML
* Polarized Light
* Multi-modal Problems

### Selected Publications
* [Teaching Cameras to Feel](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14487.pdf) [ECCV 2020]
* [H2O-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05309.pdf) [WACV 2021]
