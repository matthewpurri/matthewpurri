### Hi there!
My name is Matthew Purri, I am currently researching and building an ML company focused on video understanding. I was recently a PhD candidate at Rutgers University (graduated May 2023). I studyied computer vision and machine learning. My thesis is concentrated on understanding object properties from visual information. I have previously interned at Amazon, Clarifai, and Kitware.
